"""Tracing a fact-check claim back to the citation the draft attaches to it.

The bug this module was written for: a claim whose fact-check item named no URL
fell back to a *response-level* grounded URL — the first entry of the provider's
search-results list for the whole response. One real run stamped a single LBNL
energy report onto 44 unrelated claims (Yorkville water rates, ICNIRP exposure
limits, IARC classifications) and reported each as unsupported by it. Two real
findings sat inside 47 false positives.

The cases below are the ones that decide whether the replacement is trustworthy.
A wrong anchor recreates the same failure at lower volume, so "returns nothing"
is a correct answer here and is asserted as often as a positive match.
